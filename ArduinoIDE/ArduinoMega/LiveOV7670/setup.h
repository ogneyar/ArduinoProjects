 *  sends data to TFT over SPI during blank lines.
 *
 *  EXAMPLE = 2
 *  Use LiveOV7670Library class that processes data pixel by pixel
 *  sends data to TFT during each pixel reading loop.
 *  VGA can not be used with line buffer since there is no
 *  time (no blank lines) to do something useful with a buffered line
 *
 *  EXAMPLE = 3
 *  Reads data from LiveOV7670Library and send it over UART to computer
 *  Java application for receiving picture from UART
