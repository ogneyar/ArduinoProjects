@par Example Description

This example shows how to use the WWDG and IWDG watchdog timers for a soft reset.

Pressing the UP button performs a soft reset using WWDG. The reset takes place immediately after the counter value is written outside the window.
Pressing the DOWN button performs a soft reset using IWDG. The reset occurs after 2 counter clock cycles (~ 250 Î¼s).
