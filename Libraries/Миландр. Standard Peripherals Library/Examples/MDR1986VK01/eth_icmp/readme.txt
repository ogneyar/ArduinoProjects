@par Example Description

This example shows, how to use Ethernet.
In this demo there are Ethernet initialisation function, Ethernet loop function to setup communication mode and
PacketAnaliser function to parse ethernet ARP and ICMP packets and answer it. 
User can validate communication using ethernet connection between PC and demo board XC5 and sending ping packets from PC.

@par Directory contains:

  - main.c              Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VK01 demo board with MDR1986VK01 
  microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR1986VK01_port.h
        MDR1986VK01_eth.h
        MDR1986VK01_clk.h
        MDR1986VK01_delay.h
        eth.h
        
  - Edit the MDR1986VK01_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
