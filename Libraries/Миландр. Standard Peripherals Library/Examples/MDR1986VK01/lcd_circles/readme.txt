@par Example Description

This example demonstrates the ability to work with a MELT LCD display on a development board. The display is connected to the microcontroller via an external system bus, so the example shows the configuration of the system bus, as well as the display of circles of different diameters.

@par Directory contains:

  - main.c              Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VK01 demo board with MDR1986VK01 
  microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR1986VK01_port.h
        MDR1986VK01_clk.h
        lcd_ebc.h
        lcd_graph.h
        
  - Edit the MDR1986VK01_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
