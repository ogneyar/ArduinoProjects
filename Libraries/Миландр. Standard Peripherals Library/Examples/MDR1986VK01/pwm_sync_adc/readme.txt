@par Example Description

This example shows, how to use PWM synchronously with ADC.
In this demo there are PWM and ADC initialisation functions and ADC interrupt handler function to highlight ADC start of conversion event using marker pin. 
User can watch PWM signal and ADC start of conversion event marker pin using oscilloscope and PB10 and PB1 pins on demo board.

@par Directory contains:

  - main.c              Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VK01 demo board with MDR1986VK01  
  microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR1986VK01_port.h
        MDR1986VK01_clk.h
        demoboard.h
        adcsync.h
        pwm.h
        
  - Edit the MDR1986VK01_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
