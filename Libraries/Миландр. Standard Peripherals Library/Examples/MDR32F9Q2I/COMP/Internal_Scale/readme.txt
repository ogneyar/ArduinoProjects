@par Example Description

This example shows how to use COMP module functions.
That action includes the following steps:
    - Configure PORTE line 2 as COMP_IN1;
    - COMP peripheral initialization;
    - COMP CVRef initialization;
    - Obtaining the result of comparison.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c             Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2I eval board with MDR32F9Q2I microcontroller.
    - Switch COMP_INP_SEL must be set on EXT_CON position.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_comp.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
