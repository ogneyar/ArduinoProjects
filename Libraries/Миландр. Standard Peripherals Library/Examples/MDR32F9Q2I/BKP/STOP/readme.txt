@par Example Description

This example shows how to use BKP module functions.
That action includes the following steps:
    - Configure PORTC line 0 as output LED;
    - Configure PORTC line 13 as input EXT_INT4;
    - Enable EXT_INT4 interrupt;
    - Enter Stop mode;
    - Turn on/off LED when EXT_INT4 interrupt occurs.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c                      Main program
    - MDR32F9Q2I_IT.c              Main Interrupt Service Routines
    - MDR32F9Q2I_IT.h              Functions prototypes for the interrupt


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2I eval board with MDR32F9Q2I microcontroller.
    - VD3 (LED1) is connected to PC.0 pin.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_bkp.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
