@par Example Description

This example shows how to use BKP module functions.
That action includes the following steps:
    - Configure PORTC line 0,1 as output LED;
    - Configure RTC clock source;
    - Enable RTC interrupts;
    - Set RTC counter,prescaller and alarm values;
    - Enable RTC;
    - Switch On\Off LED1 when SECF Flag is set;
    - Switch On LED2 when ALRF is set.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c                          Main program
    - MDR32F9Q2I_IT.c                  Main Interrupt Service Routines
    - MDR32F9Q2I_IT.h                  Functions prototypes for the interrupt


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2I eval board with MDR32F9Q2I microcontroller.
    - VD3 (LED1), VD4 (LED2) are connected to PC.0, PC.1 pins, respectively.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_bkp.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
