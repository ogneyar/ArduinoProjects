@par Example Description

This example shows how to use UART.
Configure PORTB lines 5,6 as UART1_TX,UART1_RX.
Configure PORTD lines 0,1 as UART2_RX,UART2_TX.
Configure UARTs on an exchange with 9600 Baud rate, 8 bit data size, 2 stop-bit and parity Even check.
Check TXFE flag before transmit.
UART2 transmit word.
Check RXFF flag before recive.
UART1 recive word.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c                  Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2I eval board with MDR32F9Q2I microcontroller.
    - Pin 19 of X26.1 and Pin 6 X26.2 must be connected together.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Library" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_uart.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
