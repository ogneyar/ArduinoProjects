@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN in loopback mode.
The CAN1 cell performs a transmission and a reception of a extended data frame by polling at 125 Kbits/s.
The received frame is checked and LED1 light up to indicate what the communication was successful, else LED2 light up.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c                        Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2I eval board with MDR32F9Q2I microcontroller.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_can.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
